"Anthropomorphic UML": visualization of code and OOP concepts in a form of human body.
* body is an object
* arm: method
* finger: argument

Can be used as a visually intuitive tool for code refactoring and teaching OOP concepts ([see example](https://github.com/dmikhr/DudeGL/wiki/Git-diff-visualization)). Written in Ruby.
